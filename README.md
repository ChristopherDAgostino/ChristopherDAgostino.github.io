Welcome to my page! My name is Christopher D'Agostino and I'm a student at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, PA.  My main focus of study is Journalism and Marketing Communications.  While this is my main area of study, I have always had a passion for filming and editing videos.  I hope to incorporate my passion into my professional career.
