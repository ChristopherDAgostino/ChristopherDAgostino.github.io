## About Me
I'm currently a third year student at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, PA.  My main focus of study is Journalism and Marketing Communications.  While this is my main area of study, I have always had a passion for filming and editing videos.  I hope to incorporate my passion into my professional career.

Data from the Wall Street Journal shows that college grads in 2013 gravitated to jobs that didn't even require a major or degree.  Check out the infographic below to learn more!
