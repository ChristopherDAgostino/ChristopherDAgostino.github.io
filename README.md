## Map Visualization of the Top 10 Party Schools in America (2013-2017)
Thanks to The Princeton Review, colleges and universities across America have been ranked by how fun the social scene on campus is.  Rankings are created by issuing tens of thousands of student surveys to hundreds of campuses, creating a list of top ten places that "have the most fun."  Because Lehigh University has been ranked more than once, I thought it'd be interesting to see where these schools are, how many times they've been ranked, and how much the list has changed in the past 5 years.  Check out the map below to see if your school knows how to party!
